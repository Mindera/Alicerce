# Contributing

All contributions are welcomed for this project! Nothing is off limits.

If you found a problem, [file an issue](https://github.com/Mindera/Alicerce/issues/new).

If you just want to contribute, feel free to look through the [issues
list](https://github.com/Mindera/Alicerce/issues), or
simply submit a PR with your idea!

## Reporting Bugs

As Swift and Cocoa evolve, this project may become out of date. Feel free to file issues to report problems. Be sure to include:

- Swift version
- Xcode version
- an example of the code where you're using Alicerce

## Code style

We try to follow the [Mindera Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/Mindera/swift-style-guide), but it's currently not enforced.

## Pull Requests

Please try to minimize the amount of commits in your pull request. 
The goal is to keep the history readable.

Always rebase your changes onto master before submitting your PR's.

Please write [good](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) commit messages:

  - Separate subject from body with a blank line
  - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
  - Capitalize the subject line
  - Do not end the subject line with a period
  - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
  - Wrap the body at 72 characters
  - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

If you need to modify/squash existing commits you've made, use [rebase
interactive](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History).

When a PR is approved, we try to merge it using GitHub's **Squash and merge** strategy, using the title as the commit message, and the remaining commits' messages and bodies as the body.
